# Measuring Nature balance: biodiveristy and disaster Indicator
My project is an interactive choropleth map application that visualizes global biodiversity and natural disaster data. Built using Python with PyQt5 and a local HTTP server, it displays the map in a desktop window through a web view widget. The project is a mix of both technical and humanitarian elements, aiming to highlight disparities in environmental impact and funding across different countries for protected areas globally.

# Final Milestone

For my final project, I created a window displaying a choropleth map using a local HTTP server and a web view widget to showcase biodiversity and natural disasters. One of the biggest challenges I faced at BlueStamp was dealing with various technical difficulties, especially while connecting my Raspberry Pi to my computer, which required running many commands just to get small results. My project combined engineering and humanities, aiming to raise awareness about global disparities in resources. In the future, I hope to build more tech-based projects that highlight social and environmental issues in accessible, meaningful ways


# Second Milestone

For my second milestone, I made a interactive choropleth map in the raspberrypi using Plotly Express and cleaned the dataset with Pandas. The map shows the percentage of protected areas by country and exports to HTML. A challenge I faced during this milestone was getting the terminal on my computer to connect properly to the Raspberrypi and for the final milestone, my goal is to display the map locally without opening a web browser.

# First Milestone!

My first milestone was essentially coding a computing screen coordinates system for my international project using a mathematical equation. However, the international space tracker couldn’t be completed because the necessary files on my computer weren’t showing up. As a result, I had to start a new project which is currently a  Biodiversity and Disaster Indicator. This project involves importing data that tracks a metric over time, followed by data processing to create a time series graph, with that being said, some of the challenges I faced while working on the computing screen coordinates were the amount of changes I had to make to meet my project’s requirements, for my second milestone I will have the choropleth map with a few other modifications.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
